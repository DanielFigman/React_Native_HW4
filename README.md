If you want to delete a category or a note from the "categories" or the "categoryScreen" screens you need to press and hold on the category/note to see the delete option. In the "Notescreen" you will have a button for this option.

If you long press on a photo you will get a delete button to delete specific image, if you just click on a photo it will open a large view of the photo.
